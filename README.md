# Assignment 2 – Optimization in Modern Power Systems

This folder contains the Python implementations of the models developed for
Assignment 2. Each model builds on the previous one to analyse how different
factors affect optimal investment in power generation technologies.

## Files
- **Model_1.py** – Myopic deterministic investment model (single-hour profit).
- **Model_2.py** – 24-hour intertemporal model with hourly dispatch.
- **Model_3.py** – Strategic investment model with auction-based CAPEX.

## How to run
Run any model directly using Python:
```bash
python Model_1.py
python Model_2.py
python Model_3.py
